# 🏠 Day 3 – House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## 📌 Objective:
To build a linear regression model that predicts house prices using various numerical and categorical features from the dataset.

---

## ✅ Tasks Completed:
- 📥 Loaded the dataset
- 🧹 Performed EDA and handled categorical features
- 🔍 Split data into training and testing sets
- ⚙️ Trained a Linear Regression model
- 📈 Evaluated using MAE, MSE, and R² score
- 🧠 Visualized Actual vs Predicted prices and Residuals

---

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used:
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

---

## 📊 Key Visuals:
- Histogram of house prices
- Correlation heatmap of features
- Scatter plot: Actual vs Predicted prices
- Histogram of residuals (errors)

---

## 💡 Insights:
- Features like `area`, `bedrooms`, and `bathrooms` influence the price positively
- Good R² score indicates strong predictive performance
- Residuals are fairly normally distributed — linear regression assumption holds
